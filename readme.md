## Installation:

  Click [here](https://github.com/Tong-Liu-128/macOs_Claude_Overlay/raw/refs/heads/main/Claude.dmg) to download the dmg installer.

  You can clone the whole repo and run

```bash
./run.py
```

  To run the tool (you may need to solve dependency issues by yourself).

  You will be prompt to allow Accessibility on first run, which is required for listen for hotkey binding input. 

  You may need to restart the app after Accessibility is granted.

  And you are good to go!


## Usage

Once installed, open it, sign in with your google account, set your favourite hotkey, and simply start your work flow.
